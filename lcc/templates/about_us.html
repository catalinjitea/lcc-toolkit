	<h2><b>The Law and Climate Change Toolkit</b></h2>
	<p>
	    The Law and Climate Change Toolkit is an online and open database being developed by a partnership among the UN Climate Change secretariat, UN Environment, and the Commonwealth Secretariat working in close collaboration with partner countries, other international organizations and research institutions. The Toolkit aims to provide a global resource to help countries put in place the legal frameworks necessary for effective national implementation of the Paris Agreement and their nationally determined contributions (NDCs).
	</p>
	<p>
	    The Toolkit is designed for the use by national governments, international organizational and experts engaging in assisting countries in implementation, as well as academia and research institutions that are analyzing the growing body of climate change-related legislation throughout the world. The key features of the Toolkit include functionalities to search existing climate change-related legislation and to undertake an assessment of a selected country’s legislation. As the development of the Toolkit progresses, and with more experience with NDCs and existing climate laws, the Toolkit will increasingly collect documentation of successes and challenges and make available information on good practices and lessons learned across the different fields of climate law-making.
	</p>
	<h3><b>Functionality</b></h3>
	<p>The toolkit is structured to provide a guided experience for users, offering a variety of functionalities under three interlinked but independent main components supported by a back-end climate legislation database. </p>
	<h4><b>1. The search function: Legislation explorer</b></h4>
	<p>Building on existing databases, the toolkit will provide access to the text of climate change related legal provisions, both within overarching climate change laws and sectoral legislation, from across the world. Through the legislation search function, users will be able to search for relevant laws and provisions by way of a free text search and/or the use of a guided taxonomy. To enhance the relevance of information provided by the toolkit, users will be also able to filter results by country, year of the legislation, and other parameters, such as country emission profiles, population, climate priorities or gross domestic product (GDP).</p>
	<h4><b>2. The assessment component: Review questions, ‘gap’ analysis, suggestions and examples
	 </b></h4>
	<p>
	    In addition to the search function, the legal assessment functionality of the toolkit provides the user with the opportunity to undertake a review of a selected country’s legislation in order to identify potential gaps and areas for improvement. This function of the toolkit is designed to help users identify priority areas for climate law review and potential areas of legislative or regulatory reform. After going through a set of interactive assessment questions covering a broad range of aspects related to one or more chosen climate or sectoral law(s), users will be presented with areas and issues that might require specific attention in legislating climate change at national level and suggestions pointing to relevant legislative examples from other countries. Results can further be tailored according to contextual factors relevant for the assessed country, such as type of legal system, population, GDP, emissions profile, adaptation priorities or focus areas for mitigation (e.g. according to a Party’s NDC). The assessment is not intended to be prescriptive but to offer options and examples for the user to draw on.
	</p>
	<h4><b>3. Collecting experience: Lessons learned explorer</b></h4>
	<p>
	    In the mid- and longer term, the first two functionalities will be complemented by options to view lessons learned and experience gained with existing climate laws. Users will then be able not only to locate provisions from national laws (via the legislation explorer), but also to obtain information on how these are being applied and ‘what works’ in climate law in different countries around the world. It is envisaged that over time more and more experience and lessons learned in the various thematic legal areas can be gathered and a growing ‘community of practice’ be built up.
